# Kaggle-forest-type-cover
This is a kaggle competition asked to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables. And this is my first time to use python to deploy GridSearchCV and random forest. I'll keep updating once I have more delicated prediction.

# Packages
numpy; pandas; matplotlib; seaborn; sklearn.ensemble; sklearn.model_selection

# Predictive Model
